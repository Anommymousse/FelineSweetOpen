# FelineSweetOpen
Code from the game feline sweet on steam, note-: this code is very bad ^_^
It's c# if you can't already tell.
The game is up on steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1723390/Feline_Sweet/

So this is MOST of the code not all of it.
The controller is not part of the upload as I used https://www.youtube.com/c/samyam as the basis for it.

Not sure there's much that's useful in there but figured might as well share it, meow it's pretty much stable.
